# Chromebook Accessibility Toolkit for CS Classroom

Making computer science education accessible through keyboard navigation.

## Quick Start

<div class="card-grid">
    {% include card.html 
        title="Start with Module 1" 
        description="Learn fundamental keyboard navigation principles"
        link="#"
        meta="Coming soon"
    %}
    
    {% include card.html 
        title="Print Reference Cards" 
        description="Ready-to-use shortcuts for teachers and students"
        link="/cards/"
        meta="Available now"
    %}
</div>

## Why Keyboard Navigation Matters

- **Accessibility**: Essential for students with motor disabilities
- **Efficiency**: Faster than reaching for the mouse
- **Ergonomics**: Reduces repetitive strain injuries
- **Focus**: Keeps hands on keyboard while coding

## Project Status
